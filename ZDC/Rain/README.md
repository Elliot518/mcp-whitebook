### Rain Streaming
>Rain streaming is a data processing component of ZDC to capture data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. 
  
Rain streaming ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.
